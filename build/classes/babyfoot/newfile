If you want to display text in the same scene when you hover over a button in JavaFX, you can use the `setOnMouseEntered` method of the `Button` class to set an event handler that changes the text of a `Label` or `Text` node. Here's an example:

```java
Button button = new Button("Hover over me");
Label label = new Label();

button.setOnMouseEntered(event -> {
    label.setText("Button hovered");
});

button.setOnMouseExited(event -> {
    label.setText("");
});
```

This code creates a `Button` and a `Label`. When the mouse enters the button, the text of the label is set to "Button hovered". When the mouse exits the button, the text of the label is cleared.

Is this what you were looking for?
